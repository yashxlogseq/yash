## **Start-up Pitch** on [[Aug 4th, 2020]] Prep
## This pitch has been constantly delayed. By consumer rating on this is the best part of 4/10 even before attending this.
## Details
##### A pitch studio is a concept that we created and it’s very successful for us, it is basically a simple way for entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas to us without any pressure. The reason why is because all great ideas should be pursued, and money should not be a problem. We bet that we can build a great relationship with you thus, increase our value over time.
##### We will evaluate the idea and yourself based on three simple things: feasibility and potential for the idea and your eagerness to start your project and become an entrepreneur. Once done we will propose either our Full Assistance plan, our Startup Assistance plan or our Partial Assistance plan. Full Assistance is our best plan and is 5 to 6 times less expensive than market cost, Startup Assistance is 3 to 4 times less expensive than market cost, and Partial Assistance is twice less expensive than market cost.
##### For the idea, feasibility means that your project can be enabled by technology or optimized by technology, potential means that your project must be scalable and become big. When it comes to you, we want to help people who really want to start an entrepreneurial project thus once we make you an offer today you will need to accept or decline it today. We have options to help you if you’re on a really tight budget such as financing options or a simple one-time fee product to start that we call an MVP-A.
## **Who are we?**
#### We are a group of students studying in an international school and have been experimenting with several business ideas since the best part of one year before CrashBoards happened.
#### Why are we starting? (We can probably ignore this points to avoid getting stuff streched)

##### We have experimented with several flawed idea's, mostly lavish concepts on paper, but we have for the first come up with a concept that (1) helps the society and (2) is actually possible in reality along with a pretty decent profit margin.
##### One of our co-founders [[Yash Agrawal]] had signed up for an online tutoring service, and there he realised the value individuals can gets from high-quality peer-peer learning + having a support network that is comprised of students in themselves. (Expanded on the ((5f24d242-8660-40e0-96c0-466b23e10fdb)) section)
##### **In our own personal circles we wanted to break the notion that social business, build on the noble foundation of helping society cannot be profitable**
##### The basic idea of CrashBoards International is to provide (1) pocket-friendly (2) short-duration intense crash courses powered by students and ex-students themselves.
#### In summary, the vision and goal for CrashBoards International is to work towards two potent targets: (1) beneficial, impactful and sustainable peer-to-peer learning and, (2) providing a source of income to students.
## **What do we offer**
#### Modelled around efficiency and flexibility as we teach the entire breadth of more than 13 subjects syllabus across two internationally recognised boards, the IGCSE (International general certificate for secondary education) and the IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme).
#### CrashBoards’ business structure offers this paid service for SG$20 - 40 per day, per student.
##### For comparison, our daily cost is half. the hourly cost of professional tutors
#### Our sessions would occur virtually during the months of June and December, aimed at students giving their board exams in the next 5-6 months.
#### The IGCSE branch of CrashBoards is inventively named CrashIGCSE, and the IBDP branch of CrashBoards will be CrashBacculureate.
##### If you are familiar with the IBDP, there are several facets of the diploma, such as the individual assessment and EE which we plan to offer aid on.
#### We have designed our business model to facilitate the online collaboration of tutors and students who require a quick revision or guidance to boost their scores in a short span of time during their summer or winter breaks.
#### We **do not** offer our courses to **teach** students, but rather offer our courses to **rigorously assess and challenge their existing knowledge about a subject** pushing it to new boundaries through a series of question papers, quizzes etc. We obviously also cover the 'challenging topics', but theoretical knowledge is given second priority in comparison to practical application of the concept.
### Duration of course
##### At CrashBoards we understand that every teacher has his/her own style of educating, and it would be waste of talent to push an educator to complete his/her teaching in a set time frame. Keeping respect of this very fact, the duration of each subject within a course will vary, and will depend on the tutor.
##### The tutor will have to consolidate all the high scoring, tough and conceptual topics to 3 hours a day for a duration of 16 to 22 days, or maximum 30 days.   We belief that 3 hours everyday expect for a Sunday, with a 10 minute break at the mid point is extremely manageable for both students and educators.
## **Whom do we hire?**

#### To minimise the cost paid by our students, keep our doors open to all, and to keep CrashBoards International pocket friendly, we need to manage our workforce, i.e, our tutors.
#### Benefits
##### (1) Actual students have greater connect and knowledge of the course and subject they are teaching as they are the ones who have given the exam. No teacher can match that level of intimacy that a student experiences with an exam.
##### (2) During the tutoring experience of Yash Agrawal, he had experienced that teaching is more than just a service. It involves more contribution (physical, mental and in terms of time), and once rewarded for this contribution, there is a lot of incentive, purpose and will to teach, serve and contribute to the society.
##### Peer to peer online teaching is highly effective and it particularly focuses on enhancing students' learning ability and critical thinking process.
#### Smartly choosing our groups of tutors, we manage to keep our costs very low.
##### In general, we are mainly to target a group of individuals who have passed through the course and are **not** pursuing professional teaching.
##### Eg: Senior high school, undergraduate and postgraduate students who will be working part-time in our organisation
### Before we move on the pricing, do have a look at our consolidated SWOT analysis.
## **Timeline + pricing**
#### Each branch of CrashBoards International will have its own website. The reason being to disperse the various options we are giving the consumer.
#### Timeline
##### The websites mark the commence of this venture and we are planning to do so at the start of October. Student and tutor registrations also begin around that time. The actual tutoring session for December will commence on 10th December 2020.
##### Our USP in terms of financial support is that, we do not need any initial investment of money. Instead. we need a lot of investment in terms of manpower and time.
#### Pricing + Revenue
##### With a 10% commission from tutors, 90% of the revenue will be given to our tutors as 'reward' for their services and give them some (1) financial incentive and (2) financial independence.
##### Our expected baseline revenue is SGD5,000 ++ in our first year of operations.
##### The broad cost for registering with us ranges from SGD480 to around SGD760 per student at the bare minimum. At the baseline, tutors with us can make an income of SGD432 to SGD684 at the bare minimum
## More details on our timeline and pricing is one the slide right now.
## **Marketing + Future?**
#### Marketing will be done via social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) and via a podcast we will be launching soon titles CrashTalks
#### As suggested by our philosophy, we aim to build "the one-shot academia to charge your brain and change your grades", we wish to pursue research in the future while teaching other national and international courses and also offering crash-courses on entry-level exams and admissions.
## **Why should u invest in us + What do we want form you?**
