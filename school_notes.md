## And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. — *Genesis 30:1–3*
### Theocratic - The government of God.
#### Theo (Latin) - God. Cracy (Latin) - Democracy
### Genesis explores in theocratic details. The concept of Genesis is the inception of creating the progeny. The woman is similar to a vessel (metaphoric representation of a womb), used for developing a child, that will carry the humanity forward. Thus, if a woman is infertile, then in a dystopic, theocratic society, she is adrift and without purpose.
#### What can such a woman do?
#### Thus, if the woman is infertile, society gives her a mandate of getting a fertile woman and presenting her as a "religious" offering to the husband. The husband is sanctioned to have intercourse with the said offering and have children.
### In this society, the identity of a woman is erased to ground zero, and treated as a womb factory, after they have been chosen to be the maid (offering).
### Psychological Trauma:- Because the woman is infertile, in order to create progeny, she has to bring in the handmaid.
### Rachel symbolises [[Serena Joy]] and Bilhah symbolises Offred -> [[biblical allusion]]
## The commander seems to have everything, but the emotional connection between the maid and the commander is missing.
## The origin of the ancient Christian doctrines, which were prevalent isn't evidence-based, yet they are taken as the truth, to justify the actions in the Gilead society.
## **Puritanism**
### The word comes from puritan, and these are the people who are (Christians) who are followers of stoic. Pure simple people. Like the old women Tejas Jiju showed us.
### Eg: New England Puritan Regime
## Because men are at the apex of the power triangle to procreate with the handmaid. He is at the top of the social, political and procreative sense. The women always come under the theocratically sanctioned men of awesomeness.
## The character of [[Offred]] → **Of**fred someone. Handmaids do not actually have any name
## The narrative voice is not of [[June]], and it is Offred instead. There is a watershed in their lives from what she was before, and what she is after the war.
## In the case of [[Firdaus]], there is no watershed. However, there is systematic development into her current personality. Both of the voices are voices of descent and are against the society they inhabit. Firdaus is much more volatile in her actions, whereas Offred, though a victim has difficulty making her mind and is this more acted upon, rather than acting herself. In both the cases, the storyteller is a victim of society.
## The timeline of the two novels/novela's:
### Memory is significantly important. In the case of Offred, memory is important because it takes her back to the life where she was normal, rational and optimistic individual. She was what she wanted to be, but after being kidnapped and being pit up as a handmaid in Gilead, what has eroded is her individuality and her aspiration to be in Gilead. From a person, she almost becomes a non-person (down to one biological entity). Thus memory here is crucial and maintains her sanity. Memory for Offred is something that she can pleasantly look back into, however, the narrative perspective is not set in the past.
### In the case of [[WAPZ]], the entire story is narrated as a flashback. The analeptic pattern is stronger, because the prisoner keeps looking into her childhood from a prison cell. It is the, retrospective vision. The voice is that of an adult trying to come to terms with what had happened to her as a child as she was growing up. The curious growing up of her mother, the oppressive father, and the sexually abusive uncle and a somewhat caring teacher. In this case, memory is much more stronger as a narrative tool/device in WAPZ.
