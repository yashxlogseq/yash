## Under the niche of science and technology, we see a growing field by the name of MedTech, or the MedTech Community - the perfect mix of technology and science. The start-up that I will be discussing later (**NDR Medical Techechnolgies**) is a company that was founded in 2015. I came across this firm during the MedTech Innovator and **APACMed Forum** (hosted in Singapore in 2019).
### _(All the information regarding NDR MedTech and its products are sourced from its website)_
## NDR MedTech (that I will be abbreviating to NDR MT throughout this report) won the highly competitive MedTech Innovator, winning a cash price among other recognitions. NDR MT developed a unique product, the **ANT** - automated needle targeting (operated by a professional surgeon). As suggested by its name, the product aims to locate, rupture and eventually remove malignant tumours from places a doctor can’t reach. ANT achieves this by a series of four unique pointers, which incidentally also give an edge in a rapidly disruptive MedTech space: (1) an integrated robotics and image analysis system, (2) a non-invasive and lower risk classification, (3) an extremely compact product with a short learning curve and (4) a one of a kind product which gives physicians to plan and create measurable outcomes.
### _(insert image of ANT)_
## Do note, throughout this report, several terms will be defined extensively to understand the importance and value of ANT. All definitions come from the Institute of Medicine (IOM).
## The ANT is a system aimed at patients and caters to two key area’s off medicine - (1) improving the patient-care system by (2) **precision medicine**. Precision medicine is a complex term, but can simply be defined as a process which reduces a medical error. In medicine, an ‘error’ is defined as the “failure of a planned action to be completed as intended (i.e., the error of execution) and the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (i.e., the error of planning)”.  Dwelling into failure is an idea that science rejects, but learning from it is what science advocates. The IOM goes on the suggest that medicine is comprised of six characteristics: (1) safety, (2) effectiveness, (3) patient-centred nature of care, (4) timely, (5) efficient and (6) equitable. NDR MT mainly targets pointers (1), (2), (3) and (5). Unfortunately, this macro classification is not suitable to understand what this start-up focuses on. To understand better, we need to understand the doctor perspective, i.e, the diagnostic perspective. Schiff and colleagues (2005) divide the diagnostic process into seven key stages: (1) access & presentation, (2) history collection, (3) physical exams, (4) testing, (5) assessment, (6) referral, and (7) follow-up. From this classification, we can derive that ANT, as a product, caters to the pointer (1) and (4).
## In summary, NDR MT has developed ANT as an effective, patient-centric and efficient system to improve access to and testing of malignant tumours.
## This might not seem like much of an improvement in the medical system. But is that true? Fundamentally, this is incorrect. We need to remember that out of 98,000 unnecessary deaths, 44,000 deaths are a direct result of medical errors. If we specifically talk about errors by doctors themselves, 45% (of doctors) reported making at least 1 error, 31% of which resulted in a patient's death.
## As I mentioned previously, ANT mainly revolves around integrated robotics and image analysis system. Though medicine has served as a breeding ground for new, innovative and disruptive imaging techniques, NDR MT has made use of two such image analysis systems (that they call **ANT software**), (1) fluoroscopic images and (2) in-situ CT images (with AI) to but the **ANT - X** and **ANT - C** respectively.
### I will dwell deep into ANT - C first as it has some more complexity then the ANT - X
## ANT - C uses in-situ CT images, a part of Phase Contrast X-Ray imaging (PCXI). The best part about this method of imaging is that I enable the physician to visualise soft tissue structures, which are usually rendered unresolved with conventional CT imaging. A potential application of this imaging could be the visualising lungs and brain. In the application fo the ANT - C, this would be the application of mapping blood vessels and surrounding organs to lead to one or more consequences from the following: (1) prevent unintentional perforations by the needle (which is basically apoptosis, i.e, cell death or cell 'suicide'), (2) decrease the variability in outcome during surgery, and (3) maintain surgeon concentration during surgery leading to (hopefully) a better patient experience.
## Now that ANT - C has been described, we can now move on and compare and contrast this product with the ANT - X. The ANT - X is basically the same ANT system as the ANT - C, but uses real-time fluoroscopic images to align and direct the needle to its intended direction. Fundamentally, the two products are vastly different. There is a specific 'process' the ANT - X method needs to adhere to. This process is summarised below:
## Entry point -> precise trajectory -> stabilisation.
## 'Stabilisation' is done using multiple planes in the ANT itself. I will eloberate on this as I conclude this report.
## The reason I have classified NDR MT as a star-up, it due to the fact that multiple clinical trials in Singapore, China, Japan and a few other Southeast Asia countries have been carried out, but there is a lack of extensive evidence that the product in its current state is actually viable to be used on a large scale and promote precision medicine. Moreover, the firm is still in the process of achieving its CE certification and is in preparation for FDA 510K submission.
## The basic timeline of the technologies developed by NDR MT can be summarised by the timeline of the awards that they have achieved.

## To conclude, I would like to talk about two key points, (1) stabilisation and (2) the practical applications of the good. In terms of the practical applications of the good, current clinical trial for ANT-X is percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ANT-C is lung biopsy and ablation, but NDR Medical Technologies claim that their product would be used to treat malignant cells in general. Finally, "the integration of ANT software and robot, harnessed with the skill and dexterity of the surgeons’ experience will manage the needle alignment and insertion process with significantly greater precision."
