## Investigating the effect of thyroxine
### Measure 50ml of distilled water in a measuring cylinder, adding it to a beaker (A). Using butter paper and a balance, measure out 0.5g of pancreatin, adding it to beaker A and mix until a clear solution is formed.
### Add 3ml of litmus cream to test-tube B, followed by 3ml of 1% pancreatin solution and 3ml of thyroxine-sodium solution for the stock solution.
### Measure the time taken for the litmus cream to turn red.
