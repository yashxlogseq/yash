## This claim has been circulating, creating headlines and being a point of discussion for just over a decade.
## Background - Article IX, section 1 of Hamilton's draft constitution provided: "No person shall be eligible to the office of President of the United States unless he be now a Citizen of one of the States, or hereafter be born a Citizen of the United States."
## Then "The Donald" claimed that Obama should "release his birth certificate" and commented how he felt "proud" that helped solve a "very very important problem".
## As this claim was circulating on various platforms
### (1) gave rise to racist and religously offensive comments
#### Repeated for Kamala Harris
### (2) This "shifts" the focus of the media, of the nation to such extents that the president himself must come up to remind Americans that we cannot waste time on "sillness" of this proportion.
## 13% of all Americans and nearly one in four Republicans continue to say he was definitely or probably born in another country. And one in five Americans still say they don't know enough to say one way or the other.
