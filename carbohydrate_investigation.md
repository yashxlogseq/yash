## This investigation is done with the aid of a standard curve. To prepare the standard curve, a 1% glucose solution is created. 0.1g of glucose is measured on a butter paper using a balance. Glucose is added to a test-tube containing 10ml distilled water (measured from a measuring cylinder). Similarly a 0%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% glucose solution is created using 0g, 0.2g, 0.3g, 0.4g and 0.5g of glucose respectivly.
## From the stock solution of 5% ^^seaweed^^, 3ml of ^^seaweed^^ solution, 3ml of thyroxine-sodium solution, 3ml of amylase and 3ml of 1% glucose solution is added to a test-tube. 3ml of this solution is taken in a cuvette, and the spectrophotometer and colorimetry values are noted for that given concentration of ^^seaweed^^ (5%). This procedure in repeated for 0%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5% of seaweed solution
## This procedure is repeated for 0%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5% of ^^seaweed^^ solution.
