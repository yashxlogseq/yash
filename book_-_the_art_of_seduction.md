### Seduction is a process that is constant. You need to use pleasure as a bait, playing on peoples emotions, stirring desire and confusion inducing **physiological surrender**.

###### The seducers are those who "understand the tremendous power contained in the moments of surrender (in love)".
###### This is something related to [[BOOK - 1984]]. Everyone who is looking for lust is doing it maybe anger? Maybe greed? Maybe envy?
####### "He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity".
###### "A person in lust is harder to control and, once satisfied, may easily leave you. Seducers take their time, create enchantment and the bonds of love" and "Creating love and enchantment becomes the model for all seductions— sexual, social, political. A person in love will surrender."
### A seducer has learned how to tone down the sexual element without getting rid out it.
### One social or sexual seduction makes the next one easier, your confidence growing and making you more alluring.
### [[Seduction as a process of penetration]]

#### This sounds a little bit crazy. When I first heard it I was, wtaf. What are you saying?
#### The two parts: Penetrate the mind of the victim.
#### The point made by [[Robert Greene]] is that once you look at the world form the eyes of the victim, you kill their "first line of defence". This can also be seen as you look at your self from their point of view. You can then work on yourself to improve the image you have on her that you see from her eyes. This does not make much sense, but it sure does.
### "First, self-absorption is a sign of insecurity; it is anti-seductive. Everyone has insecurities, but seducers manage to ignore them, finding therapy for moments of self-doubt by being absorbed in the world."
### "What people lack in life is not more reality but illusion, fantasy, play." and "Seduction is a kind of theater in real life, the meeting of illusion and reality."

#### "If you strategize without paying attention to the parts of your character that draw people to you, you will be seen as a mechanical seducer, slimy and manipulative. If you rely on your seductive personality without paying attention to the other person, you will make terrible mistakes and limit your potential."
## **Part one: The Seductive Character**
### The idea of seduction is more like ice breaker in my opinion. It is all about the first impression.
#### "Successful seductions begin with your character, your ability to radiate some quality that attracts people and stirs their emotions in a way that is beyond their control."
### Summary
#### Rakes insatiably adore the opposite sex, and their desire is infectious.
#### Ideal Lovers have an aesthetic sensibility that they apply to romance.
#### Dandies like to play with their image, creating a striking and androgynous allure. Naturals are spontaneous and open.
#### Coquettes are self-sufficient, with a fascinating cool at their core.
#### Charmers want and know how to please—they are social creatures. Charismatics have an unusual confidence in themselves.
#### Stars are ethereal and envelop themselves in mystery."
### **The Siren**
#### This is the macho man type thing. This and the rake are something that I am not. This is what [[Robert Greene]] told in the start itself - you may not connect with all of them, but you will connect with atleast one of them.
##### _"The notion of danger, challenge, sometimes death, might seem outdated, but danger is critical in seduction."_
#### The idea of danger is something that is stressed upon. You need to be a risk taker to actually be "seductive" in this catagory.
##### The main instrument of power of the Siren is "always the physical".

##### "Sirens are often fantastically irrational, which is immensely attractive to men who are oppressed by their own reasonableness. An element of fear is also critical: keeping a man at a proper distance creates respect so that he doesn't get close enough to see through you or notice your weaker qualities."
#### This is also a #BusinessAdvice : "In their immediacy they bypass rational processes, having the same effect that a decoy has on an animal, or the movement of a cape on a bull."
##### You should have the capability to decive. This goes very well with the idea that I was talking with [[Mom]], that you should know how to repackage already existing ideas that can make you a benefit some day.
##### It should be done in a way that people don't know, like an aiyaar (a person who changes form) or a decoy

##### **The smile**
###### A notion that Bollywood and other sources of love advice have given us, is that it is all about the smile. This is not true. As Arjun Reddy says, it should be about the way how you breathe, not your physical features.
####### "Although a smile and an inviting look are infinitely seductive, they must never dominate your appearance. They are too obvious and direct."
###### "Related to this is the notion of selective disclosure, the revealing of only a part of the body—but a part that will excite and stir the imagination."
####### Example: "Queen Catherine de Médicis of France, was one of the first women ever to incorporate decolletage in her wardrobe, simply because she had the most beautiful breasts in the realm."
##### **The Voice**
###### The other thing is that this is about the voice.
####### "Perhaps that power is regressive, recalling the ability of the mother's voice to calm or excite her child even before the child understood what she was saying."
###### This is the voice that a Siren or a seducer in general must have, in my opnion.
###### "Marilyn Monroe was born with her breathy, childlike voice, but she learned to lower to make it truly seductive. Lauren Bacall's voice is naturally low; its seductive power comes from its slow, suggestive delivery."
###### "The Siren never speaks quickly, aggressively, or at a high pitch." #Quote
####### This is what I realised what make people [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] so 'sexy' in some kind. The slow voice, the balanced intesity is what men and women find so attractive and what they find a glue.
####### This is what intense speakers like Suraj Kumar and BeerBiceps lack.
#### **"The key: everything must dazzle, but must also be harmonious, so that no single ornament draws attention."**
