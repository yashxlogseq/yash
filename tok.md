## FLASHCARDS
## The three idea's from RLS
### ()1) being the idea of data-mining
### (2) the idea of firms running behind profit and raking in cash and
### (3) the fact that the ethical stances of many firms are still pretty 'weak'.
## Claim counterclaim set one
### AOK - Ethics
### WOK - Perception and reason
### Ethics can simply be defined as the study of how to live our lives morally
### **'profit is god and anything in its pursuit is justifiable'.**
### Example 1
#### Eg: 1996 issue of the life magazine
##### 12 y/o Pakistani boy sewing a nike ball for 6 cents
#### Acceptable -> How? Cutting costs -> using cheap labour = $$$
#### Apt example of ultilitarianism
### **'profit is a key motive, but is not the only motive. The profit comes after general legal, ethical and moral stance, and should not be a reason for data mining/theft'**
### Example
#### Mica example -> Celeb's adore on the red carpet
##### Miniral
##### Mined in UK, using mostly child labour as there is a lack of education + a lack of finances
