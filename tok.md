## FLASHCARDS
## **The three idea's from RLS**
### (1) being the idea of data-mining
### (2) the idea of firms running behind profit and raking in cash and
### (3) the fact that the ethical stances of many firms are still pretty 'weak'.
## **Claim counterclaim set one**
### AOK - Ethics
### WOK - Perception and reason
### Ethics can simply be defined as the study of how to live our lives morally
### **'profit is god and anything in its pursuit is justifiable'.**
### Example 1
#### Eg: 1996 issue of the life magazine
##### 12 y/o Pakistani boy sewing a nike ball for 6 cents
#### Acceptable -> How? Cutting costs -> using cheap labour = $$$
#### Apt example of ultilitarianism
### **'profit is a key motive, but is not the only motive. The profit comes after general legal, ethical and moral stance, and should not be a reason for data mining/theft'**
### Example
#### Mica example -> Celeb's adore on the red carpet
##### Miniral
##### Mined in UK, using mostly child labour as there is a lack of education + a lack of finances
#### Suppliers
##### Reduce transperency
#### The key steps to reduce child labour
##### rigorous checks of the supply chain of mica
##### producing their own mica, i.e, synthetic mica
#### The second one adhere'a to corporate social responsibility and the categorical imperative
##### The categorical imperative states that every action you take should be rigorously assessed in terms of its moral acceptability.
### Profit earnings by a firm are not correlated with them being ethical
### Profit may be a key motive for any firm, but in this day and age, it is certainly not the only key motive and priority. A firm may choose not to exhibit csr, which is absolutely fine as long as they remain in the legal boundaries of the country they operate in.
### Final example of #CSR
#### ‘body shop’, which has garnered a reputation of being animal cruelty-free from day 1.
## **Second RLS** -> Revised [[Secondary RLS]]
### (a) steal our data and moreover (b) use that data to influence our political ideology.
### Google Ads executive Scott Spencer wrote in a blogpost that they apply the same ads policies to everyone. An email to advertisers shared by Cory Booker’s deputy campaign manager claims that under Google’s new rules, ads that refer to candidates, political parties or ballot measures will be barred from using some of Google’s powerful tools that combine data sources and target individual users. Google also reported its conjoined effort with Twitter to voluntarily limit its political advertising offerings before the UK general election and the 2020 US presidential election.
### _Hopes that this will_ reduce the incentives gained by data mining, which is mostly for targeted advertisement.
## **Limitations**
### …Fiasco between CA FB and law
### (1) Firms in themselves and consumers may have differing ethical morals which pushes one to do something the other finds unethical
### (2) Manipulation by the firms involved
#### CA CEO stating that they dint have FB data, but they actually did. The whole firm was built on FB data
### (3) We may not know the complete picture or extent of the truth as there are multiple powerful factions involved in this matter
## After nearly a year of its critics demanding that Facebook respect users’ privacy, here was Facebook saying: “Fine, privacy you shall have.", and as the Wired put it, "the Great Privacy Awakening". There has been a growing mistrust and a growing recognition that companies can no longer be left to regulate themselves. Facebook also implemented end to end encryption. Is this good or bad? In the words of the WIRED "it could also do plenty of damage, creating even more dark spaces on the internet for misinformation to spread and for criminal activity to fester".  This fiasco has sparked a conversation at the least, once purely the domain of academics and privacy nerds, into the mainstream, quoted WIRED.
