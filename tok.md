## FLASHCARDS
## The three idea's from RLS
### ()1) being the idea of data-mining
### (2) the idea of firms running behind profit and raking in cash and
### (3) the fact that the ethical stances of many firms are still pretty 'weak'.
## Claim counterclaim set one
### AOK - Ethics
### WOK - Perception and reason
### Ethics can simply be defined as the study of how to live our lives morally
### **'profit is god and anything in its pursuit is justifiable'.**
### Example 1
#### Eg: 1996 issue of the life magazine
##### 12 y/o Pakistani boy sewing a nike ball for 6 cents
#### Acceptable -> How? Cutting costs -> using cheap labour = $$$
#### Apt example of ultilitarianism
### **'profit is a key motive, but is not the only motive. The profit comes after general legal, ethical and moral stance, and should not be a reason for data mining/theft'**
### Example
#### Mica example -> Celeb's adore on the red carpet
##### Miniral
##### Mined in UK, using mostly child labour as there is a lack of education + a lack of finances
#### Suppliers
##### Reduce transperency
#### The key steps to reduce child labour
##### rigorous checks of the supply chain of mica
##### producing their own mica, i.e, synthetic mica
#### The second one adhere'a to corporate social responsibility and the categorical imperative
##### The categorical imperative states that every action you take should be rigorously assessed in terms of its moral acceptability.
### Profit earnings by a firm are not correlated with them being ethical (and hence) ethics plays a huge part in the income source or sources of any firm.
### Profit may be a key motive for any firm, but in this day and age, it is certainly not the only key motive and priority. A firm may choose not to exhibit csr, which is absolutely fine as long as they remain in the legal boundaries of the country they operate in.
### Final example of #CSR
