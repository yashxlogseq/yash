### By the year 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human being on the planet
### What is [[Big Data]]? -> Data capturing, storage, sharing, querying
### [[Big Data]] refers to humongous volumes of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications that exist. This can be done by the help of [[Technology]]
### The definition of [[Big Data]], given by Gartner, is, “Big data is high-volume, and high-velocity or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.”
### Applications
#### 1. Financial services
##### The common problem among them all is the massive amounts of multi-structured data living in multiple disparate systems, which can be solved by big data. Thus big data is used in several ways like:
####### Customer analytics
####### Compliance analytics
####### Fraud analytics
####### Operational analytics
#### 2. Communications
##### ability to combine and analyze the masses of customer-generated data and machine-generated data that is being created every day.
#### 3. For retail
##### This requires the ability to analyze all the disparate data sources that companies deal with every day, including the weblogs, customer transaction data, social media, store-branded credit card data, and loyalty program data.
### Requirments
#### Analytical skills
#### Creativity
#### Maths and statistics
#### Computer science -> [[Technology]]
#### Business skills

## https://study.com/academy/lesson/how-science-technology-are-related.html#:~:text=Science%20is%20the%20study%20of,impossible%20to%20separate%20the%20two.
### Science is the study of the natural world by collecting data through a systematic process called the scientific method. And technology is where we apply science to create devices that can solve problems and do tasks. Technology is literally the application of science. So, it really is impossible to separate the two
## https://www.gildshire.com/how-are-technology-and-science-related/
### All technology instruments, from medical scanners to smartphones are connected and related to science. Without science, all technological gadgets would not even exist. Science offers the knowledge needed for creating, developing and improving any technological device.
### The main connection between [[Science]] and [[Technology]] is that technology is the application of science. I can draw a venn diagram that shows them in one another. Technology is completely submerged into science
### Also, a knowledge base can help scientists to improve strategies of applied research.
### Science provides knowledge which is a direct source for new technological possibilities. Without scientific knowledge, there is no application of the information gained through scientific methods. Science also gives us a knowledge base that becomes important in the assessment of technology and their social and environmental impact. Also, a knowledge base can help scientists to improve strategies of **applied research**.
## The clear complete overlap between science and technology can be seen in the [[microchip]] example from Triggered Insaan's YouTube channel (story time)
## It is not possible to put every aspect of this topic in the one venn diagram. It needs to be done in various diagram

### There is clearly a **'pipeline model'** when it comes to the innovation process of new tech.
### Science -> applied research -> design -> manufacturing -> commercialisation and marketing
### ^^The confusion between engineering (originating from technology) and science^^
### Indeed the relationships between science and technology are very complex, though interactive, and are often different in different fields and at different phases of a technological ‘life cycle’.
### **It is important here to note that technoiogy is not just things, but also embodies a degree of generic understanding, which makes it seem more like science, and yet it is understanding that relates to a specific artifact, which distinguishes it from normal scientific understanding.**
### A more common example of a direct genetic relationship between science and technology occurs when the exploration of a new field of science is deliberately undertaken with a general anticipation that it has a high likelihood of leading to useful applications, though there is no specific end-product in mind. The work at Bell Telephone Laboratories and elsewhere which led eventually to the invention of the transistor is one of the clearest examples of this. The group that was set up at Bell Labs to explore the physics of Group IV semiconductors such as germanium was clearly motivated by the hope of finding a method of making a solid state amplifier to substitute for the use of vacuum tubes in repeaters for the transmission of telephone signals over long distances.
### The conclusion was “that most scientific fields are much more strategically
important to technology than data on direct transfers of knowledge would lead us to believe” (Pavitt, 1991).
### In general, the assessment of technology, whether for evaluating its feasibility to assess entrepreneurial risk, or for foreseeing its societal side-effects, requires a deeper and more fundamental scientific understanding of the basis of the technology than does its original creation, which can often be carried out by empirical trial-and-error methods.
#### For example, the manufacture of a new chemical may involve disposal of wastes which require knowledge of the groundwater hydrology of the manufacturing site.

### The Hubble telescope is a very powerful telescope that orbits Earth like a satellite. Scientists placed the Hubble telescope into space so it could make clear images like this without background lights on Earth competing with the dim light from distant stars. It has led to many scientific discoveries.
#### This shows that [[Technology]] is enabled by science and this further expands the knowledge of science
## https://www.diffen.com/difference/Science_vs_Technology#:~:text=The%20words%20science%20and%20technology,the%20practical%20application%20of%20science.
### The words science and technology can and often are used interchangeably. But the goal of science is the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake while the goal of technology is to create products that solve problems and improve human life.
### Science from the Latin scientia (knowledge) is a system of acquiring knowledge based on the scientific method, as well as the organized body of knowledge gained through such research. Science as defined here is sometimes termed pure science to differentiate it from applied science, which is the application of scientific research to specific human needs.
### Technology is a broad concept that deals with a species' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species' ability to control and adapt to its environment.
### Science refers to a system of acquiring knowledge. This system uses observation and experimentation to describe and explain natural phenomena. The term science also refers to the organized body of knowledge people have gained using that system.
### The problem is, though, that many of these lessons should properly be termed “technology” but are all too often referred to as "Applied Science".

## https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/big-data
### Big data is often characterized by the 3Vs: the large volume of data in many environments, the wide variety of data types stored in big data systems and the velocity at which the data is generated, collected and processed. These characteristics were first identified by Doug Laney, then an analyst at Meta Group Inc., in 2001; Gartner further popularized them after it acquired Meta Group in 2005. More recently, several other Vs have been added to different descriptions of big data, including veracity, value and variability.
### Businesses that utilize big data hold a potential competitive advantage over those that don't since they're able to make faster and more informed business decisions, provided they use the data effectively.
### Big data is also used by medical researchers to identify disease risk factors and by doctors to help diagnose illnesses and conditions in individual patients. In addition, data derived from electronic health records (EHRs), social media, the web and other sources provides healthcare organizations and government agencies with up-to-the-minute information on infectious disease threats or outbreaks.
### Big data also encompasses a wide variety of data types, including the following:
#### structured data in databases and data warehouses based on Structured Query Language (SQL);
#### unstructured data, such as text and document files held in Hadoop clusters or NoSQL database systems; and
#### semistructured data, such as web server logs or streaming data from sensors.
