## Summary
### - Your task for the day: **40 Points**
### We often think [[Science]], [[Technology]] and [[Big Data]] are all to the core very interlinked. While they do share similarities, they also have their distinctions. Your first task is to research the 3 industries and create a Venn Diagram of the 3 sectors. Along with it - also write justifications and details of the confluences of the sectors.
#### Tip: You can put numbers in the Venn Diagram and then refer to the numbers below in the document and expand on your claims.
#### Eg - Technology and Data - AI, ML, Data Science, Technology and Science - Scientific Simulations of Reactions etc.
### Key Metrics of Performance:
#### Accuracy of Points - 10 Points
#### Logical Interpretation - 10 Points
#### Correlation- 10 Points
#### Justification of claims - 10 Points
### [Sample Template](https://tinyurl.com/Research-STEM-Task-1)
### By the year 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human being on the planet
### What is [[Big Data]]? -> Data capturing, storage, sharing, querying
### [[Big Data]] refers to humongous volumes of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications that exist. This can be done by the help of [[Technology]]
### The definition of [[Big Data]], given by Gartner, is, “Big data is high-volume, and high-velocity or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.”
### Applications
#### 1. Financial services
##### The common problem among them all is the massive amounts of multi-structured data living in multiple disparate systems, which can be solved by big data. Thus big data is used in several ways like:
####### Customer analytics
####### Compliance analytics
####### Fraud analytics
####### Operational analytics
#### 2. Communications
##### ability to combine and analyze the masses of customer-generated data and machine-generated data that is being created every day.
#### 3. For retail
##### This requires the ability to analyze all the disparate data sources that companies deal with every day, including the weblogs, customer transaction data, social media, store-branded credit card data, and loyalty program data.
### Requirments
#### Analytical skills
#### Creativity
#### Maths and statistics
#### Computer science -> [[Technology]]
#### Business skills

## https://study.com/academy/lesson/how-science-technology-are-related.html#:~:text=Science%20is%20the%20study%20of,impossible%20to%20separate%20the%20two.
### Science is the study of the natural world by collecting data through a systematic process called the scientific method. And technology is where we apply science to create devices that can solve problems and do tasks. Technology is literally the application of science. So, it really is impossible to separate the two
## https://www.gildshire.com/how-are-technology-and-science-related/
### All technology instruments, from medical scanners to smartphones are connected and related to science. Without science, all technological gadgets would not even exist. Science offers the knowledge needed for creating, developing and improving any technological device.
### The main connection between [[Science]] and [[Technology]] is that technology is the application of science. I can draw a venn diagram that shows them in one another. Technology is completely submerged into science
### Also, a knowledge base can help scientists to improve strategies of applied research.
### Science provides knowledge which is a direct source for new technological possibilities. Without scientific knowledge, there is no application of the information gained through scientific methods. Science also gives us a knowledge base that becomes important in the assessment of technology and their social and environmental impact. Also, a knowledge base can help scientists to improve strategies of **applied research**.
## The clear complete overlap between science and technology can be seen in the [[microchip]] example from Triggered Insaan's YouTube channel (story time)
## There is clearly a **'pipeline model'** when it comes to the innovation process of new tech.
## Science -> applied research
