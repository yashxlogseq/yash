Your first task is to research the 3 industries and create a Venn Diagram of the 3 sectors. Along with it - also write justifications and details of the confluences of the sectors.
#### Tip: You can put numbers in the Venn Diagram and then refer to the numbers below in the document and expand on your claims.
#### Eg - Technology and Data - AI, ML, Data Science, Technology and Science - Scientific Simulations of Reactions etc.
### Key Metrics of Performance:
#### Accuracy of Points - 10 Points
#### Logical Interpretation - 10 Points
#### Correlation- 10 Points
#### Justification of claims - 10 Points
