## Summary
### - Your task for the day: **40 Points**
### We often think [[Science]], [[Technology]] and [[Big Data]] are all to the core very interlinked. While they do share similarities, they also have their distinctions. Your first task is to research the 3 industries and create a Venn Diagram of the 3 sectors. Along with it - also write justifications and details of the confluences of the sectors.
#### Tip: You can put numbers in the Venn Diagram and then refer to the numbers below in the document and expand on your claims.
#### Eg - Technology and Data - AI, ML, Data Science, Technology and Science - Scientific Simulations of Reactions etc.
### Key Metrics of Performance:
#### Accuracy of Points - 10 Points
#### Logical Interpretation - 10 Points
#### Correlation- 10 Points
#### Justification of claims - 10 Points

### By the year 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human being on the planet
### What is [[Big Data]]? -> Data capturing, storage, sharing, querying
### [[Big Data]] refers to humongous volumes of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications that exist. This can be done by the help of [[Technology]]
### The definition of [[Big Data]], given by Gartner, is, “Big data is high-volume, and high-velocity or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.”
### Applications
### 1. Financial services
#### The common problem among them all is the massive amounts of multi-structured data living in multiple disparate systems, which can be solved by big data. Thus big data is used in several ways like:
###### Customer analytics
###### Compliance analytics
###### Fraud analytics
###### Operational analytics
### 2. Communications
#### ability to combine and analyze the masses of customer-generated data and machine-generated data that is being created every day.
### 3. For retail
#### This requires the ability to analyze all the disparate data sources that companies deal with every day, including the weblogs, customer transaction data, social media, store-branded credit card data, and loyalty program data.
