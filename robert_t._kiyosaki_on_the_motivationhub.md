## “I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of being afraid of it. They don’t teach that in school and, if you don’t learn it, you become a slave to money.”
## "The moment I start paying you think like an employee. Entrepreneurs work for free."
## Making money is basically playing monopoly in real life: 4 green houses 1 red hotel.
### Acquire assets and that becomes bigger assets.
## “Don’t be addicted to money. Work to learn. don’t work for money. Work for knowledge.” – [[Robert T. Kiyosaki]] #QUOTE #EVERGREEN
