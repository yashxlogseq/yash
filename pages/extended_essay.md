## CHECKLIST
### TODO The multiple experiment stuff
### TODO Hypothesis
### DONE Check availability of casein. **NOT AVAILABLE**
### TODO Make procedure suitable to your experiment
### DONE Experiment - Effect of thyroxine on the rate of digestion
### DONE Experiment - The control experiment
### DONE Which enzyme?
### TODO Method to quantify lipid metabolism
### DONE MPV - A for procedure in GDocs
## This procedure can be repeated for lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. I am not too sure about that though.

## **PROTEIN**

### The effect of thyroid hormones on protein metabolism is characterized by a profound stimulatory effect on the synthesis of numerous cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins as well as of secretory proteins such as albumin and hormones.
## **LIPID**

#### T4-stimulated lipid mobilization was indicated by decreased total lipids, primarily as triacylglycerols, and increased lipolytic enzyme (triacylglycerol lipase) activity in the liver and dark muscle.
##### This can be something. I can take liver, maybe get it from somewhere, and then I can test on it? Why should this not work?
#### T4-stimulated lipid mobilisation from mesenteric fat was indicated by decreased total tissue mass and by increased lipase activity.

#### Their most obvious and well-known action is the increase in basal energy expenditure obtained acting on protein, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
#### No direct lipolytic effect has been found in vitro. The increased lipolytic rate produced by thyroid hormones in vivo might be rela- ted to the increased subcutaneous blood- ̄ow or to a modi®cation of the lipolytic action of catecholamines.
### The liver thing is something that I am drawn to, lol.
## **CARBOHYDRATE**
