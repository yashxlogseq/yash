## The two companies that I would be discussing
### [Zenyum](https://www.zenyum.com/sg-en) and [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com)
### Funding
#### USD15.1M for Zenyum and USD100M ++ for Tempus
## Why did I choose these two?
### I have had braces before, and the cost aspect is something that I failed to capitalise on
### Tempus is focusing on precision medicine that is basically something that is a key aspect.
## Another firm that I came across was spacemaker, but that was something that did not fit the theme that I needed.
## **ZENYUM**
### 10 countries
### There is some real good pricing. They are transparent in a way, and disclose everything upfront. A clear system that make braces less of a ball-ache to figure out the logistics for to a system which actually makes some decent sense.
