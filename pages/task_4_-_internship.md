## Details
### Task: Choosing an industry (but under Tech & Big Data!) and analyzing it from a start-up perspective. You have to choose startups in that domain and analyze them along with the dynamics of the industry.
### Explanation: Tech startups are the next big thing. Before we go in too deep into something, it is very important to take a broader look at several perspectives and nobody provides it better than startups. Choose 2 startups - one well established (e.g. Google) and one startup in the growth phase or failed to gain traction, but is still there (e.g. SlideBean).
### Write a brief report - an overview of the industry and its players.
#### Recommended Structure:
#### Industry overview
#### market share (pie chart), size of the entire market, ease of entry, what are the technological barriers, any legal hurdles? Prerequisites? Competitor analysis, growth opportunity in the market.
#### Analysis of market data (refer to reports of Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG and other organizations such as McKinsey and BCG)
#### Any significant mergers and acquisitions in the industry?
#### Data & Analytics
### Brief on use of data and analytics, (Cloud storage, Machine Learning (Deep learning algorithms) solutions.
### Comparison & Company Prospects
### Comparative study between the 2 startups selected
### Optional Add on - Innovative Business Models

## The two companies that I would be discussing
### [Zenyum](https://www.zenyum.com/sg-en) and [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com)
### Funding
#### USD15.1M for Zenyum and USD100M ++ for Tempus
## Why did I choose these two?
### I have had braces before, and the cost aspect is something that I failed to capitalise on
### Tempus is focusing on precision medicine that is basically something that is a key aspect.
## Another firm that I came across was spacemaker, but that was something that did not fit the theme that I needed.
## [[Zenyum]]
### 10 countries
### There is some real good pricing. They are transparent in a way, and disclose everything upfront. A clear system that make braces less of a ball-ache to figure out the logistics for to a system which actually makes some decent sense.
#### all you pay for your clear aligners is $2,400
#### 70% more affordable than other clear aligners on the market, that can range anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000. In fact, Zenyum is even more affordable than traditional metal braces, which cost upwards of $3,500.
#### Initial doctor consultation ($120–$170), Re-scan post treatment ($100), Retainers ($300)
#### Process
##### Initial consultation -> money goes to partner clinics
#### Payment plan laid out very specifically.
### From the website
#### The lack of supervision or involvement by a certified dentist means that you’re exposing yourself to an increased risk of infection and tooth damage.
#### No duty of care means that no one is held responsible for the safety and success of the treatment. If something goes wrong, sometimes the orthodontic treatments required to fix the damage are much more expensive than having taken precautions at the beginning.
### An easy to use the system, which relies on technology to survey patients, communicate with patient's and depends on AI to actually make the invisible braces.
#### 6 Free (additional sets of braces if stuff has not worked according to plan)

## **TEMPUS**
### Bring technology to the physicians who see patients every day.
### "rich" genomic data
### MedTech -> **what is the basic goal?** to improve patient outcome.
### Build precision oncology and a system that can power that
### **Website details**
#### **GOAL**: With the world’s largest library of clinical and molecular data, and an operating system to make that data accessible and useful, we enable physicians to make real-time, data-driven decisions to deliver personalized patient care, and in parallel, facilitate discovery, development, and delivery of optimized therapeutic options for patients through distinctive solution sets.
#### With the right data, we can accelerate cancer research.
#### We can usher in an era of true precision medicine and revolutionize how data is used to personalize and optimize treatments.
#### We can harness the power of data to redefine cancer care.
#### Our genomic tests analyze DNA, RNA, and proteomic data to understand a patient's tumor at the molecular level so we can identify treatment options tailored to each and every patient.
#### Our platform analyzes thousands of clinical and molecular data points, connecting physicians with up-to-date treatment options and relevant insights for patients based on their unique molecular profile and our advanced analytics and machine-learning algorithms.
## Definition of precision medicine: Precision medicine is a medical model that proposes the customization of healthcare, with medical decisions, treatments, practices, or products being tailored to a subgroup of patients, instead of a one‐drug‐fits‐all model.

## [[The rise and rise of medtech in Asia]]
### **THE MEDTECH SPACE IS ALL ABOUT SCALABILITY. IF YOU CANT SCALE, YOU CANT SUCEED**
### Success in Asia does not come easy—on the contrary, it requires agility, innovation, and long-term commitment to stay abreast of trends in this fiercely competitive market.
### Asia today already represents 23 percent of the global market. Within the next five years (by 2023), Asia will eclipse Europe to become the second-largest regional market. During that period, Asia will also be the major growth engine among global medtech markets, contributing 35 percent of total incremental growth (Exhibit 1).

### At the same time, APAC executives—especially general managers in China and India—feel their existing portfolios don’t adequately meet the needs of their customers.
#### That is the reason why so many market players image. There is always more skill to be aquired, and once done, it opens a new door in the APAC market
### While confidence in premium innovation is high, only 30 percent of companies expressed confidence in their ability to develop locally relevant products that would allow them to scale in broad market segments (Exhibit 5).

#### This is why many firms, and solution for that matter are lavish idea on paper. Idea that we students also build, young entrepreneurs and industry newbie's are people who have such great idea's, but are unable to realise until a few months into the project that their idea no matter how essential in this case to the medical community will actually not get funding or approval for that matter due to it not being a "market appropriate innovation". I could have proposed two systems in (for example) during the period of the black death or yellow fever, (1) a MRI system and a (2) microscope. The microscope would have anytime made more sense, as it is something that the market needed at that time. That is what physicians and researchers needed. They honestly did not need a brain scanning ability **relative** to that of the microscope (stress on relative).
#### That is why you need industry specialist at your side not during, or not only during product testing but during product design and ideation to actually make it scalable. This is something that relates 
##### Build localized, agile organizations and over-invest in talent.

### [[Mid- and lower-tier customer needs]]
ds
#### That is thought that I had. So let's take the example of a firm known as X MedTech. I know that they are building this solution to bring breast cancer screening to every part of India, but how do you actually make a business out of it?
#### A product cannot actually be set to serve low-tier costumers, because this business though nobel is not scallable in any sense. Most innovators in the MedTech space, and I am guilty of this, look for a premium product to a low tier costumer. This is possible, I do not disagree, but this model is simply not scalable.
##### When it comes to scalability, another aspect that plays an important role is the efficiency part of it. YOU may not be very profitable, our you may not be making a net positive income flow, but when you have an apt system that enables the marriage of automation and ecosystem, like [[Zenyum]] can actually benefit yo
### [[Patients are turning to digital channels]]
#### This the key. YOU do not need to bring MedTech to people. YOU need to bring MedTech to people packaged into a software, packaged into a (as much as possible) digitised product all together. This is something that [[Zenyum]] has done
### The fact that organizations with senior global representation in Asia experience better communication and decision-making points to the importance of smooth local-global collaboration—this is a lever to empower Asia that surprisingly few companies are using at the mom
