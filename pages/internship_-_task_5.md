### The best Asian companies are competing with global leaders and benefit from sharp insights into local market needs and nimbler organizations. In contrast, global leaders are often slower in responding to patient needs and cannot shift resources as quickly. Too frequently, local teams have limited input on longer-term decisions related to product development or manufacturing. Global med-tech companies in the region must offer their local leaders greater autonomy to optimize decisions and resource allocations.

### In this infographic we the digital transformation part of it what give the scope for automation. Though one part of making MedTech, it is a key part in the **optimizing** process
ents. Healthcare demand already outstrips supply in Asia–Pacific, and the gap will grow in line with continued increases in income, population, disease burdens, and general awareness of health issues.
### Asia–Pacific is a complicated collection of individual markets, often with little in common other than a shared continent. Political systems, economic development, cultural mores, and disease profiles, among other characteristics, vary widely from one country to the next.
#### **Relate to ->** The disease profile is something that is seen in the NHS. The various drug profiles + the antibiotic production.
### limited financial resources and a frugal attitude toward spending on healthcare
#### This is something that is required for medtech.
### an underdeveloped medical infrastructure and workforce, which affects the adoption and use of new technology
#### YOU can come up with the best software but, given the current infrastructure, there is limited scope for its application. YOU may have [[Market appropriate innvoation]], but the market itself has not adapted to adopt that technology. Going back to the microscopic invention example, that it is inapt. There was a lack of technological advancement at that time to actually build a microscope to study diseases. Though it was a [[Market appropriate innvoation]], the medical field in the time of the black death was inept at applying the invention to the current scenario.
### First, they should reexamine their commercial models and channels. Successful companies will have to build a range of go-to-market models that cater to patients with diverse needs and account for varying levels of healthcare awareness.
#### This once again connects to the fact of [[Patients are turning to digital channels]] and is something that [[Zenyum]] does so well with its online integration. Another example would be that of money transfer.
