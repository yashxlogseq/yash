### The best Asian companies are competing with global leaders and benefit from sharp insights into local market needs and nimbler organizations. In contrast, global leaders are often slower in responding to patient needs and cannot shift resources as quickly. Too frequently, local teams have limited input on longer-term decisions related to product development or manufacturing. Global med-tech companies in the region must offer their local leaders greater autonomy to optimize decisions and resource allocations.

## When Zenyum first launched, the biggest challenge was convincing customers that their product was genuine. “Getting them to believe in the legitimacy, quality, and effectiveness of our product was an uphill task,” Artopé said. “This is where having licensed dentists in all the cities we operate in helped us a great deal.”
### This connects to me at a #personal level. When the general price range starts from SGD8,000 and when I myself paid SGD10,000 + to get my braces done, it is definitely a shock to hear that the same thing can be done within SGD3,000.
## What distinguishes Zenyum is a combination of teamwork with its partner dentists, ensuring that everyone receives personal treatment, as well as a stellar customer success team, which provides step-by-step assistance.
ents. Healthcare demand already outstrips supply in Asia–Pacific, and the gap will grow in line with continued increases in income, population, disease burdens, and general awareness of health issues.
### Asia–Pacific is a complicated collection of individual markets, often with little in common other than a shared continent. Political systems, economic development, cultural mores, and disease profiles, among other characteristics, vary widely from one country to the next.
#### **Relate to ->** The disease profile is something that is seen in the NHS. The various drug profiles + the antibiotic production.
### limited financial resources and a frugal attitude toward spending on healthcare
#### This is something that is required for medtech.
### an underdeveloped medical infrastructure and workforce, which affects the adoption and use of new technology
#### YOU can come up with the best software but, given the current infrastructure, there is limited scope for its application. YOU may have [[Market appropriate innvoation]], but the market itself has not adapted to adopt that technology. Going back to the microscopic invention example, that it is inapt. There was a lack of technological advancement at that time to actually build a microscope to study diseases. Though it was a [[Market appropriate innvoation]], the medical field in the time of the black death was inept at applying the invention to the current scenario.
### First, they should reexamine their commercial models and channels. Successful companies will have to build a range of go-to-market models that cater to patients with diverse needs and account for varying levels of healthcare awareness.
#### This once again connects to the fact of [[Patients are turning to digital channels]] and is something that [[Zenyum]] does so well with its online integration. Another example would be that of money transfer.
##### Though out of context, financial transfer, stocks etc. have "reexamined their commercial models" to suite the times better.

## Rapid growth in industrialization and urbanization is attracting the population of different semi-rural and rural areas towards the urban parts of the world. People are moving to various locations and countries in search of education or jobs. This, as a result, is driving the need for cross-border transactions. Moreover, the usage of digital remittance services offers users with high security and privacy.
