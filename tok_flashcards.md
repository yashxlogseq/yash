## FLASHCARDS
## **The three idea's from RLS**
### (1) being the idea of data-mining
### (2) the idea of firms running behind profit and raking in cash and
### (3) the fact that the ethical stances of many firms are still pretty 'weak'.
## From these key idea's we derive three KQ's
### While the first two are too narrow, the third one (state) allows us to explore the three main ideas from the RLS in greater detail than the other two.
## **Claim counterclaim set one**
### AOK - Ethics
### WOK - Perception and reason
### Ethics can simply be defined as the study of how to live our lives morally
### **'profit is god and anything in its pursuit is justifiable'.**
### Example 1
#### Eg: 1996 issue of the life magazine
##### 12 y/o Pakistani boy sewing a nike ball for 6 cents
#### Acceptable -> How? Cutting costs -> using cheap labour = $$$
#### Apt example of ultilitarianism
### **'profit is a key motive, but is not the only motive. The profit comes after general legal, ethical and moral stance, and should not be a reason for data mining/theft'**
### Example
#### Mica example
##### Miniral
##### Mined in UK, using mostly child labour as there is a lack of education + a lack of finances
#### In most case scenario's, suppliers resort to reducing transparency.
#### To exhibit CSR, firms resort to two key steps:
##### rigorous checks of the supply chain of mica
##### producing their own mica, i.e, synthetic mica
#### The second one adhere'a to corporate social responsibility and the categorical imperative
##### The categorical imperative states that every action you take should be rigorously assessed in terms of its moral acceptability.
### As we have established, Profit earnings by a firm are not correlated with them being ethical
### Profit may be a key motive for any firm, but in this day and age, it is certainly not the only key motive and priority. A firm may choose not to exhibit CSR, which is absolutely fine as long as they remain in the legal boundaries of the country they operate in.
### Moreover there are companies who are known to give equal importance to being ethical, portraying CSR and being profitable -> **BODY SHOP**
## **Limitations**
### …Fiasco between CA FB and law
### (1) Firms in themselves and consumers may have differing ethical morals which pushes one to do something the other finds unethical
### (2) Manipulation by the firms involved
#### Former CA CEO -> don't have facebook data and do not work with facebook data
#### This is "fundamentally not true" as we know now, as the entire firm itself was built on facebook data.
### (3) We may not know the complete picture or extent of the truth as there are multiple powerful factions involved in this matter
## After nearly a year of its critics demanding that Facebook respect users’ privacy, here was Facebook saying: “Fine, privacy you shall have.", and as the Wired put it, have a "Great Privacy Awakening".
## There has been a growing mistrust and a growing recognition that companies can no longer be left to regulate themselves.
## Recently, Facebook also implemented end to end encryption. Is this good or bad? In the words of the WIRED "it could also do plenty of damage, creating even more dark spaces on the internet for misinformation to spread and for criminal activity to fester".
## **Second RLS** -> Revised [[Secondary RLS]] roiters
### This controversy regarding President Obama's place of birth has been circulating, creating headlines and being a point of discussion for just over a decade
### President Trump once claimed that Obama should "release his birth certificate", and once released, commented on how he felt "proud" that helped solve a "very very important problem".
### As this claim was circulating on various platforms
#### (1) gave rise to racist and religously offensive comments
#### (2) Shifted the focus of the media and the nation to such an extent that the President himself had to remind Americans that we cannot waste time on "silliness" of this proportion.
### **The growing influence of social platforms** -> 13% of all Americans and nearly one in four Republicans continue to say he was definitely or probably born in another country. And one in five Americans still say they don't know enough to say one way or the other.
Returning back to our orignal RLS, we must recognise that this data scandal has sparked a conversation at the least, once purely the domain of academics and privacy nerds, into the mainstream.
## With those words, Aadit and I would like to thank you for your time.
