## Research
## **Apparatus and Chemicals**
### Ninhydrin solution
### Protease
### Protein source
### Spectrophotometer
### Balance
### 250ml Conical Flask (×)
### Funnel and filter paper (or centrifuge)
### Stirring rod
### Thermometer
### Temperature bath (or heat source -- Bunsen burner or hot plate)
### Pipets, 1ml, 10ml
### Graduated cylinder (×
### $$x$$ml Beakers (×)
### $$x$$ml Beakers (×)
## Make a 10g\L protein mixture by dissolving albumin in water
## Make a 5g/L saturated pepsin solution
### Why not trypsin and not pepsin?
### Pepsin is an enzyme that acts in the stomach, and is a stomach acid. Trypsin in a pancreatic enzyme that is secreted by the pancreases and is something that acts in the small intestine.
## Mix 50ml of albumin solution and 50ml of pepsin solution
## Add 10ml of 1 molar HCl
### The ratio is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BPEuLcR4_I) video
## Add 25ml of 5% #TBD (seaweed) solution
### 5g of seaweed powder will be added to 100ml of water to create a 5% seaweed solution
### Add half the volume of 5% crushed seaweed solution.
#### DONE How will you be getting the seaweed?
##### Lazada + Local store
#### DONE Genus + Species?
##### Potential target: _Laminaria Digitata_ (kombu kelp) found on [Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg/products/kombu-powder-i356266853-s831106321.html?exlaz=d_1:mm_150050845_51350205_2010350205::12:1025267241!54483208270!!!pla-297963845945!c!297963845945!831106321!138962662&gclid=CjwKCAjwsan5BRAOEiwALzomX0Cawyb0jV1lVOPRKdftoxPIUlBQB3d7HDq2ehAkxUtbyJCOzAu7YhoCNncQAvD_BwE)
## **Investigating the effect of thyroxine** -> Add 50ml of thyroxine solution
### Thyroxine obtained from
### Make a 150mcg/L solution of thyroxine solution (based on an image in a research paper)
## Note the time at the start of the hydrolysis reaction.
## Let it be for 1hour
## Withdraw 5 ml of the solution and measure the amino acid concentration of the solution as a function of time by using the ninhydrin colourimetric method.
### 0.35g of Ninhydrin + 100ml ethanol/acetone in test-tube + parafilm to prevent evaporation of alcohol
### **Chemical process**
##### 1. alpha-amino acid + ninhydrin -> reduced ninhydrin + alpha-amino acid + H2O
##### 2. alpha-amino acid + H2O -> alpha-keto acid + NH3
##### 3. alpha-keto acid + NH3 -> aldehyde + CO2
### Suggested sampling time interval: ​10 minutes for at least one hour. Colour change: from yellow (colour of ninhydrin) to purple
### ninhydrin, which is originally yellow, reacts with amino acid and turns deep purple
### **Wavelength**:​ 570nm
### Physical process​: 1ml of ninhydrin solution in 5ml solution of amino acid
## Repeat the process for 15%, 25%, 35%, 50% seaweed solution
## Dependent variable: Rate of digestion and absorbance (using ninhydrin colorimetry)
## **_What are we measuring additionally?_**
### (1) Enthalpy - Using a temperature probe every 4 minutes. The reason is that that will help us get a wide range of value (15 values) and can aid in noticing minor fluctuations in the temperature.
### (2) pH
#### How thyroxine effects pH?
#### Why does thyroxine effect pH?
### For both things, a polynomial regression model can be plotted.
### Discussion -> The potential effects of pH or temperature change
## **Control Variables**
### (1) No activator present
#### Activators are molecules that bind to enzymes and increase their activity. If activators were present, the effect of iodine cannot be tested in isolation
### (2) Concentration of enzymes
#### To test the effect of iodine in isolation
#### A bulk solution of enzymes was created, from which the tests were carried out from
### (3) Concentration of albumin
#### To test the effect of iodine in isolation
#### A bulk solution of albumin was created, from which the tests were carried out from
### (4)  pH of reaction
#### Enzymes are pH sensitive, hence the pH needs to be maintained low.
#### 1ml 1 Molar HCl was added to the solution to maintain the pH at 1
### (5) Temperature at which the reaction is carried out
#### Enzymes are temperature sensitive, which enhances its performance
#### The reaction is conducted in a incubator at a temperature of 37ºC
## **DISCUSSION**
### Homoeopathic doctors ask for the supplementary intake of seaweed to supplement patients with iodine deficiency with iodine. I want to test the effect seaweed has on thyroxine in itself.
