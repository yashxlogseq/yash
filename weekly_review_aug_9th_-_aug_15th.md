## This week has dates that were pretty interesting. It started with the Singapore Independence and then ended with the Indian Independence day.
## I have done some great work btw. I did some work on [[Biology Internal Assessment]], but if you know you know, I did some SUBSTANTIAL work on [[Extended Essay]].
## TODO I need to figure out the storage part of it.
## [[Aug 10th, 2020]] was the day I figured out what to do for my EE.
## This week in general has been pretty good if you ask me myself.
