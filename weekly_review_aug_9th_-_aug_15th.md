## This week has dates that were pretty interesting. It started with the Singapore Independence and then ended with the Indian Independence day.
## I have done some great work btw. I did some work on [[Biology Internal Assessment]], but if you know you know, I did some SUBSTANTIAL work on [[Extended Essay]].
## [[Aug 10th, 2020]] was the day I figured out what to do for my EE.
## This week in general has been pretty good if you ask me myself.
## Interestingly, I also applied for an internship! The [[Financial Transistor Internship]]. Also, we FINALLY had our [[CrashBoards x Waxdale Pitch]]
## It was a preety eventful week tbh, and I hope this continues. In terms of academiscs, it has been really, really compromised. It is now time to get full force into the swing of things. I swear.
## In terms of tasks that I completed, [[Day 1 - Task 1: Submission]] is something that I am proud of <3.
