## **Procedure**
### $$5g×6$$ of YPD broth was taken on a butter paper (measured using a balance) added to 600ml of water (measured using a measuring cylinder) and mixed with a glass rod until a clear yellow solution is formed
### $$5g×6$$ of _S. cerevisiae_ are taken in 6 beakers which have water heated to 40ºC
#### The temperature is to activate _S. cerevisiae_
### The _S. cerevisiae_  solution was mixed using a glass rod until a milky solution was formed
### 0.2g of pure PPA was taken in 100ml of water to make a 0.1g/100ml PPA solution
#### This process was repeated with 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 g of PPA
### Using a syringe, 10ml each concentration of PPA was poured into 5 250ml conical flasks
### Using a syringe, 10ml of water was poured into 1 conical flask
### 100ml of YPD broth was poured into each of the 6 conical flasks
### 100ml of the _S. cerevisiae_ solution was each added into the conical flask
### The conical flask was wrapped with aluminum foil and parafilm
### The conical flask was incubated at RTP for 5 hours
### The solution was tested using a colorimeter
#### 3ml of each of the solutions in the conical flask was added to 6 different cuvettes
#### 3ml of distilled water was put into a cuvette and the colorimeter was blanked
#### Each of the solutions absorbance was noted
### The solution was tested using a spectrophotometer
#### 3ml of each of the solutions in the conical flask was added to 6 different cuvettes
#### 3ml of distilled water was put into a cuvette and the spectrophotometer was blanked
#### Each of the solutions absorbance was noted
### The solution was tested using a hemocytometer
#### 1ml of each of the solutions in the conical flask was added to 9ml of water
#### 1ml of methyline blue was added to 9ml of water
#### 1ml of the _S. cerevisiae_ solution was added to 9ml of methyline blue solution to make the dilution factor of 100.
#### The hemocytometer and cover slip was washed using distilled water and cleaned with 70% ethanol
#### Using a micropipette a small amount of the yeast and methyline blue solution was added to the hemocytometer whihc was covered with a cover slip
#### The hemocytometer is analysed under a microscope (40× zoom)
