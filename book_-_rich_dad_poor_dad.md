## **Introduction**
### "The love of money is the root of all evil" and "The lack of money is the root of all evil". This also goes to show that whatever you do, money is not the solution, but in all its entirety is "the root of all evil".
### “One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle-class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in school.” 
#### This is something that I have been hearing for ages. This is #life and something that I really want to address. [[Why don't schools teach money?]]
### "How will a nation survive if teaching children about money continues to be left to parents—most of whom will be, or already are, poor?”
### There should be a change in mindset from "I cant afford it" (a sign of mental illness) to "how can I afford it".
#### As [[Robert T. Kiyosaki]] suggests, that we should ask questions that mentally challenge us, questions that actually put our brains on  "mental exercise" and stuff that puts your brain to work.
#### As our friend [[Tim Ferris]] says in the [[Book - The 4-Hour Workweek]], we need to challenge the conventional, and not settle for the conventional.
### "Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth."
### There is also this mindset shift regarding the poor and being broke: "Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal"
### "I don't work for money! Money works for me!"
### “Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth. ”
#### This quote is much like the standard regressive Indian bullshit we here, and frankly what I saw in the Shah family: the display of wealth, and the underlining matter of fact that wealth = power.
## **Lesson 1: The rich don't work for money**
### The idea that "It's all about the climb", is also bought up here. In terms of money: “You’re only poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did something. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You’ve done something.”
### This is just s #fun comment: “School is beginning, or it’s over in 10 seconds”
### The moment you think that you are done and that you want to quit life has a learning for you. Life is waiting for you to fail at that moment. Life is waiting for you to give up. But, at that same time, life is also willing to give you an opportunity to learn. But if you keep being angry over the fact that you have failed, the learning that life is trying to give you will suddenly be shrouded in fog and will become impossible to see. #LifeAdvice
#### “I’m quitting,” I told Mike at lunchtime. School was boring, and now I did not even have my Saturdays to look forward to. But it was the 30 cents that really got to me.
#### This time Mike smiled.
#### “What are you laughing at?” I asked with anger and frustration.
#### “Dad said this would happen. He said to meet with him when you were ready to quit.”
#### “What?” I said indignantly. “He’s been waiting for me to get fed up?”
#### “Sort of,” Mike said. “Dad’s kind of different. He doesn’t teach like your dad. Your mom and dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man of few words. You just wait till this Saturday. I’ll tell him you’re ready.”
### “But that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s something I want you to learn.’"
### **Lesson 1: “The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.” **
### The idea of fear, money and passion
#### You see, true learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined.
#### When it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them. Fear does.
### The lack of financial education in school leads to the emotion of fear in the context of money. This fear comes in the form of “ the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over”, and that is why people do not want to know how to make money, because of the flawed classic notion that money is given in exchange of time and effort.
#### This is also the idea of #PassiveIncome and what [[Ali Abdaal]], YouTuber's and video content creators that you make something once, and then they can continuously make money as you sleep.
### "People's lives are forever controlled by two emotions - _fear and greed_". This fear has already been described, but the greed aspect is new: “The fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.”
### The entire mindset surrounding money is something that is flawed. When we say we work, especially in the Indian communities, we fail to admit that we work out of fear. The fear of society, what people perceive, and the fact that we need a  and stuff like that. We assume that money soothes out this fear, but then the fear that one day you might lose it all kicks in.
#### “Instead of admitting the truth about how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think.
#### They feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe the fear, but it doesn’t. It continues to haunt them and they return to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it doesn’t. Fear keeps them in this trap of working, earning money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them.”
### “The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money.”
