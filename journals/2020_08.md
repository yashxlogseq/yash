### Today I feel stressed. I am having a one of a kind battle between quality and quantity. My communication with Sutha Ma'am does not seem to be hitting where it's supposed to, and my entire curriculum is spiralling down. But I refuse to give up, I promise to mend my ways. Let's do this lad, you can do it. If you can initiate and build a business empire in 3 months, baby, you can do what you want to in life. Rest assured, mend your ways, and keep moving forward.
### As I said, there is a conflict between time and quantity. All of this takes time, and there is no way that I will be able to do another EE if this fails.
### Further in the day I got an interview for [[Financial Transistor Internship]], and guess what, I fucking got selected!

#### DONE Body shop has carved a niche in the market by following CSR. This is because due to the influence of social platforms other businesses faced backlash as they were not adhering to CSR resulting in them losing sales even though the had a higher profit margin leading to losses. In todayâ€™s day and age people understand the importance of saving the environment and animals. Hence due to this body shop decided to implement CSR and have lower margins of profit or charge a higher price which customers are willing to pay as this reduces damage to the environment.
