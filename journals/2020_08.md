### Today I feel stressed. I am having a one of a kind battle between quality and quantity. My communication with Sutha Ma'am does not seem to be hitting where it's supposed to, and my entire curriculum is spiralling down. But I refuse to give up, I promise to mend my ways. Let's do this lad, you can do it. If you can initiate and build a business empire in 3 months, baby, you can do what you want to in life. Rest assured, mend your ways, and keep moving forward.
### As I said, there is a conflict between time and quantity. All of this takes time, and there is no way that I will be able to do another EE if this fails.
