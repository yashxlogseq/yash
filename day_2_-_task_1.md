## [NDR Medical Technologies](https://ndrmedical.com/beta/) They have such a good website. It is so informative and so simple. I love it. This is the standard [[CrashBoards International]] must follow.
### **What is this product?**
##### **AUTOMATED NEDLE TARGETING (ANT)**
##### Robotics systems with artificial intelligence and image processing for automated lesion targeting
##### Integration of both hardware and software for automated needle positioning
##### AI based algotithms also allows the system to use training data to continually of how lesions are targeted.
### Short description
#### Integrated robotic system with Image analysis
#### Costs-effective, simple usage, faster and more accurate
#### Non-invasive and lower risk classification
#### Smart device with short learning curve
#### Costs effective, simple usage, faster and more accurate
#### Create measurable outcome and increase the competency of the junior doctor
### **How it works?**
#### ANT works well with existing imaging modalities like C-arm fluoroscopy and CT-scan using 2D images to access 3D target with precision
#### Real time imagery from imaging modalities is fed directly into our ANT system
#### Automatically generates a precise trajectory from a chosen entry point on the surface of the skin to a target deep within the body
#### ANT is locked in position and provides a mechanical guide, awaiting the insertion of a needle by the surgeon
### Current applications
#### Lung cancer
### **We design what we believe**
#### NDR Medical established Automated Needle Targeting (ANT) with a mission to harness technological innovation to make surgery better and safer. As pioneers in the artificial intelligence minimally invasive field, we continue to create revolutionary breakthroughs everyday
### **How ANT works**
#### Access for trajectory planning and complex target navigation with existing image modalities. Analysis of planned trajectory path
#### Automatically generates a precise trajectory from a chosen entry point on the surface of the skin to a target deep within the body
#### ANT robot is locked in position and provides a stabilised mechanical guide, awaiting the insertion of a needle by the surgeon
### **ANT X**
#### ANT-X automates the alignment using real-time fluoroscopic images. It automatically generates a precise trajectory from a chosen entry point on the surface of the skin to a target deep within the body. The position is then maintained and provides a mechanical guide, awaiting for the insertion of a needle by the surgeon. The path of the needle is stabilised in multiple planes to ensure path of the needle stays aligned to the target

##### PCNL procedure requires establishment of keyhole access for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) to remove kidney stones larger than 20mm. A hollow needle is required to puncture the skin, position and insert it through the body layers to reach the stone target through the posterior calyx with the assistance of a real time C-arm fluoroscope (x-ray).
##### Current difficulties include uncertainties and complexity in gaining precise renal access to kidney potentially causing increased surgery duration and risk of multiple misaligned punctures made. Therefore, PCNL is usually only performed and supervised by veteran surgeons.
##### The advent of ANT X introduces image registration to real-time positioning combined with the precision adjustment and guiding technology. The integration of ANT software and robot, harnessed with the skill and dexterity of the surgeons’ experience will manage the needle alignment and insertion process with significantly greater precision. With the alignment process automated through ANT software, radiation exposure to the surgeon’s hands is significantly reduced as well. The surgery assisted robotic device stabilizes and holds the needle firmly at the planned insertion point, awaiting for the insertion of needle by surgeons.
##### Essentially, surgeons will have to focus only on the depth of insertion instead of the conventional multidirectional adjustments. This simplifies the surgery technique such that the procedure could be shortened even for the less experience surgeon that eventually allows more surgeons to acquire and maintain the skill. ANT X creates the potential for surgery to be operator independent, ensuring consistent surgical outcomes regardless of surgeon’s experience.
### **ANT C**
#### ANT automate the positioning and alignment using in-situ CT images with AI, providing the location and verification of the malignancy of the tumor. AI also helps with mapping of blood vessels and surrounding organs which are taken in context and consideration upon planning the trajectory- avoiding unintentional perforations. ANT C lessens the analytical work to navigate in three-dimensional space thus reduces variability during surgery, allowing surgeons to concentrate on the surgical procedure and ensuring patient’s safety.

##### For lung biopsy and ablation, the key problem faced are incidence of complications such as pneumothorax, bleeding and infection which can potentially be fatal.
##### One of the causation of such complications lies in the biopsy needle insertion process.  Current process involves surgeon having to plan the entry point and angle of insertion. Poor planning however can result in suboptimal needle insertion path and higher risk of biopsy complications. Depending on the skill of the clinician, it can be very difficult to insert the needle exactly where the surgeon envisioned. Variation in the experience of the surgeon can also cause uncertainty in the effects of insertion.
##### With ANT’s technology, target identification and feature mapping using AI for access trajectory planning is now possible. Complex target navigation with existing imaging modalities using computer vision and image analysis for data integration is conducted to optimise surgery in order to reduce complications. The robot’s position is then calibrated using reference markers and the angle of insertion is automatically set and stabilized to prevent unintentional skewed movements of needle. Effective targeted precision and reduced surgical complications is achieved. In addition, the smart system is accompanied with a simple user friendly interface adapted to current processes for surgeons. Consistency in biopsy and ablation results can be attained even with less experienced surgeons. Furthermore, with ANT’s minute deviation in accuracy, it allows for targeting of small lung nodules during early stages of lung cancer. This directly correlates to possibly earlier detection and hence enabling detection and hence enabling patients to receive cancer treatments in early stages with better clinical outcomes. ANT C is currently undergoing animal trial for lung biopsy surgery.
### Designed especially for different image modalities to revolutionise precision without compromising speed and safety
