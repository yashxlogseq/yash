### **Task**: typing up the various aspects learned throughout the week
### **Explanation**
#### Some people say that learning from failure is more important than celebrating success - and we believe it's important. That’s why, now look into a company in the same industry which has FAILED. Similar to earlier analysis into tech start-ups, get into why this one failed. Understand what went wrong - was it mismanagement? Not good enough a product? Lack of funding?
#### With this - you’ll have a wholesome understanding of the industry and will be able to comment on the future of the industry and where it is headed.
Cumulate, adapt and infer all the data collected throughout the week. This would be a summary of the entire industry from a past - present and future perspective.
#### Please make sure that you make apt visual content in terms of comparing and contrasting all the 3 companies from each other.
### **Tip**: divide the report into 3 sections - past, present and future, each with an infographic and a 500 word summary of the time/development. (this is after you analyze the failed startup)
### **Recommended Structure**
#### Failure in space and 3 key reasons it failed - from various standpoints. (first part for the report)

### Grounded in science and regulated by the government, health care is a challenging sector.
### The 10 reasons for failure
