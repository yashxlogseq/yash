### **Task**: typing up the various aspects learned throughout the week
### **Explanation**
#### Some people say that learning from failure is more important than celebrating success - and we believe it's important. That’s why, now look into a company in the same industry which has FAILED. Similar to earlier analysis into tech start-ups, get into why this one failed. Understand what went wrong - was it mismanagement? Not good enough a product? Lack of funding?
#### With this - you’ll have a wholesome understanding of the industry and will be able to comment on the future of the industry and where it is headed.
Cumulate, adapt and infer all the data collected throughout the week. This would be a summary of the entire industry from a past - present and future perspective.
#### Please make sure that you make apt visual content in terms of comparing and contrasting all the 3 companies from each other.
### **Tip**: divide the report into 3 sections - past, present and future, each with an infographic and a 500 word summary of the time/development. (this is after you analyze the failed startup)
### **Recommended Structure**
#### Failure in space and 3 key reasons it failed - from various standpoints. (first part for the report)
#### Infographic - Past (early days) of the technology and companies
#### Infographic - Present situation of the technology and companies
#### Infographic - Future of the technology and industry (5 years)

### Grounded in science and regulated by the government, health care is a challenging sector.
### The 10 reasons for failure
#### 1. Failure to properly articulate your value proposition
##### Too many companies in health care describe themselves as “better, faster, cheaper” than what’s already on the market.
##### How is your solution better? How much faster? How much cheaper than the **standard of care**?
##### You need to understand the **health care economics** for each stakeholder.
##### Health care companies are required to amass specific evidence and data to achieve key milestones such as raising capital, regulatory clearance or approval, and obtaining insurance reimbursement or payment. A common mistake is thinking about evidence generation in a linear manner and focusing just on what is needed for the next milestone. This is a common and costly error that can significantly delay time to success.
#### 2. Not having an end-to-end evidence generation strategy
##### Health care companies are required to amass specific evidence and data to achieve key milestones such as raising capital, regulatory clearance or approval, and obtaining insurance reimbursement or payment. A common mistake is thinking about evidence generation in a linear manner and focusing just on what is needed for the next milestone. This is a common and costly error that can significantly delay time to success.
###### Take it back to the Evernote vs Roam Research. Business works like a web (Roam Research), and is not linear
##### Far too many startups succeed in achieving a regulatory milestone but then run out of funding before generating sufficient evidence to convince customers to buy their products.
#### 3. Choosing the wrong CEO
##### Common ways to tell if you need to replace the CEO — even with an acting CEO — include overconfidence, dismissiveness, arrogance, and a lack of transparency about important details.
#### 4. Staying in stealth too long
##### To be successful, a company needs to be talking to investors, customers, health care providers, patients, and potential acquirers early and often. Stakeholder input is needed early to avoid mistakes that can kill a company down the road.
###### "If you rely on your seductive personality without paying attention to the other person, you will make terrible mistakes and limit your potential."
###### The seductive nature here can be implied to be the USP of the firm, while the 'other person' is the investor.
#### 5. Thinking the direct-to-consumer model will make life easier
##### The idea of [[Patients are turning to digital channels]]
##### The problem is that this relies on the often-flawed assumption that consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for health-related products and services.
###### This turns to the fact that healthcare, like in the UK, is neither free or like in Malaysia cheap (which recieves for
