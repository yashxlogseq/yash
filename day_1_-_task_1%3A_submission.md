## Topic: Science, Technology and Big Data
## To put it in simple words, it is not possible to add all the various aspects of this topic into one single venn diagram.
## I will begin by analysing Big data and technology. Big Data refers to humongous volumes of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications that exist. In general, big data is generally concerned with all things data - data capturing, sharing and querying. This is the fundamental understanding which leads me to depict technology and big data in the following diagram:

## To be fair, data is what enables technology. How can I claim this? Well, this is due to it's 6V's, its relation to technology because of which big data is a proper subset of technology.
### The 6V's include: Volume, variety, velocity, veriety
