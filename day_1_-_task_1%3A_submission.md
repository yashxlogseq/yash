## Topic: Science, Technology and Big Data
## To put it in simple words, it is not possible to add all the various aspects of this topic into one single venn diagram.
## I will begin by analysing Big data and technology. Big Data refers to humongous volumes of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications that exist. In general, big data is generally concerned with all things data - data capturing, sharing and querying. This is the fundamental understanding which leads me to depict technology and big data in the following diagram:

## To be fair, data is what enables technology. How can I claim this? Well, this is due to it's 5V's, its relation to technology because of which big data is a proper subset of technology.
### The 6V's include: Volume, variety, velocity, value and variability.
## Technology needs to get input from a multitude of sources. This enables accuracy. Further, variety in this data can spark even more technology and innovation. Value and variability also come under the same reasoning.
## Another reason that Big Data is a subset of technology is that big data in itself is enabled by technology. Data loggers can be a good example of the same. They allow us to collect data while being technical pieces of equipment themselves. They also advocate and enable the discovery of new trends, patterns, innovation and science. I have established how Big Data is at the epicentre of science and technology.
## Now comes the relative complex task of representing science and technology, Big data and science.
## "It is important here to note that technology is not just things, but also embodies a degree of generic understanding, which makes it seem more like science, and yet it is understanding that relates to a specific artefact, which distinguishes it from normal scientific understanding."
## I propose the following diagrams. They will be explained in detail through the course of the article.
##
## The relationships between science and technology are very complex, and they need to be studied in a life cycle manner.
## Science usually follows the following 'lfe cylce':
##
## In simple terms: "Science is the study of the natural world by collecting data through a systematic process called the scientific method. And technology is where we apply science to create devices that can solve problems and do tasks. Technology is literally the application of science. So, it really is impossible to separate the two."
## "A more common example of a direct genetic relationship between science and technology occurs when the exploration of a new field of science is deliberately undertaken with a general anticipation that it has a high likelihood of leading to useful applications, though there is no specific end-product in mind. The work at Bell Telephone Laboratories and elsewhere which led eventually to the invention of the transistor is one of the clearest examples of this. The group that was set up at Bell Labs to explore the physics of Group IV semiconductors such as germanium was clearly motivated by the hope of finding a method of making a solid state amplifier to substitute for the use of vacuum tubes in repeaters for the transmission of telephone signals over long distances."
## This excerpt is what shows the close, yet distant relations of technology and science, hence rendering my propsed figure accurate.
## For figure 3, we must understand that science provides knowledge which is a direct source for new technological possibilities. Without scientific knowledge, there is no application of the information gained through scientific methods.
## All technology instruments, from medical scanners to smartphones are connected and related to science. Without science, all technological gadgets would not even exist. Science offers the knowledge needed for creating, developing and improving any technological device.
## In simple words, the connection between science and technology is that technology is an application of science.
## In summary, my claims can be supported by the following venn diagram.
