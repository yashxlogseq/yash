### Apparatus and Chemicals
#### Ninhydrin solution
#### Protease
#### Protein source
#### Spectrophotometer
#### Balance
#### 250ml Conical Flask (×)
#### Funnel and filter paper (or centrifuge)
#### Stirring rod
#### Thermometer
#### Temperature bath (or heat source -- Bunsen burner or hot plate)
#### Pipets, 1ml, 10ml
#### Graduated cylinder (×
#### $$x$$ml Beakers (×)
#### $$x$$ml Beakers (×)
### Make a 10g\L protein mixture by dissolving albumin in water
### Make a 5g/L saturated pepsin solution
#### Why not trypsin and not pepsin?
#### Pepsin is an enzyme that acts in the stomach, and is a stomach acid. Trypsin in a pancreatic enzyme that is secreted by the pancreases and is something that acts in the small intestine.
### Mix 50ml of albumin solution and 50ml of pepsin solution
### Add 10ml of 1 molar HCl
#### The ratio is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BPEuLcR4_I) video
### Add 25ml of 5% #TBD (seaweed) solution
#### 5g of seaweed powder will be added to 100ml of water to create a 5% seaweed solution
#### Add half the volume of 5% crushed seaweed solution.
##### DONE How will you be getting the seaweed?
###### Lazada + Local store
##### DONE Genus + Species?
###### Potential target: _Laminaria Digitata_ (kombu kelp) found on [Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg/products/kombu-powder-i356266853-s831106321.html?exlaz=d_1:mm_150050845_51350205_2010350205::12:1025267241!54483208270!!!pla-297963845945!c!297963845945!831106321!138962662&gclid=CjwKCAjwsan5BRAOEiwALzomX0Cawyb0jV1lVOPRKdftoxPIUlBQB3d7HDq2ehAkxUtbyJCOzAu7YhoCNncQAvD_BwE)
### **Investigating the effect of thyroxine** -> Add 50ml of thyroxine solution
#### Thyroxine obtained from
#### Make a 150mcg/L solution of thyroxine solution (based on an image in a research paper)
### Note the time at the start of the hydrolysis reaction.
### Let it be for 1hour
### Withdraw 5 ml of the solution and measure the amino acid concentration of the solution as a function of time by using the ninhydrin colourimetric method.
#### 0.35g of Ninhydrin + 100ml ethanol/acetone in test-tube + parafilm to prevent evaporation of alcohol
#### **Chemical process**
###### 1. alpha-amino acid + ninhydrin -> reduced ninhydrin + alpha-amino acid + H2O
###### 2. alpha-amino acid + H2O -> alpha-keto acid + NH3
###### 3. alpha-keto acid + NH3 -> aldehyde + CO2
#### Suggested sampling time interval: ​10 minutes for at least one hour. Colour change: from yellow (colour of ninhydrin) to purple
#### ninhydrin, which is originally yellow, reacts with amino acid and turns deep purple
#### **Wavelength**:​ 570nm
#### Physical process​: 1ml of ninhydrin solution in 5ml solution of amino acid
### Repeat the process for 15%, 25%, 35%, 50% seaweed solution
### Dependent variable: Rate of digestion and absorbance (using ninhydrin colorimetry)
### **_What are we measuring additionally?_**
#### (1) Enthalpy - Using a temperature probe every 4 minutes. The reason is that that will help us get a wide range of value (15 values) and can aid in noticing minor fluctuations in the temperature.
#### (2) pH
##### How thyroxine effects pH?
##### Why does thyroxine effect pH?
#### For both things, a polynomial regression model can be plotted.
#### Discussion -> The potential effects of pH or temperature change
### **Control Variables**
#### (1) No activator present
##### Activators are molecules that bind to enzymes and increase their activity. If activators were present, the effect of iodine cannot be tested in isolation
#### (2) Concentration of enzymes
##### To test the effect of iodine in isolation
##### A bulk solution of enzymes was created, from which the tests were carried out from
#### (3) Concentration of albumin
##### To test the effect of iodine in isolation
##### A bulk solution of albumin was created, from which the tests were carried out from
#### (4)  pH of reaction
##### Enzymes are pH sensitive, hence the pH needs to be maintained low.
##### 1ml 1 Molar HCl was added to the solution to maintain the pH at 1
#### (5) Temperature at which the reaction is carried out
##### Enzymes are temperature sensitive, which enhances its performance
##### The reaction is conducted in a incubator at a temperature of 37ºC
### **DISCUSSION**
#### Homoeopathic doctors ask for the supplementary intake of seaweed to supplement patients with iodine deficiency with iodine. I want to test the effect seaweed has on thyroxine in itself.
